LinkedIn Mobile SDK for iOS End User License Agreement

This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn”) with offices at 
2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043 and you and governs your use of the LinkedIn Mobile Software 
Development Kit for iOS.  The LinkedIn Mobile Software Development Kit for iOS (“iOS SDK”) consists of the software, 
documentation and other materials (but expressly excluding the LinkedIn APIs) that LinkedIn may provide to you to enable, 
among other things, integration of certain LinkedIn APIs into your iOS applications.  By using the iOS SDK, you agree to the 
terms of this Agreement.  If you are using the iOS SDK on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the 
authority to bind such entity to this Agreement.  

1. License Grant; Restrictions.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, LinkedIn grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, 
royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform 
and distribute the iOS SDK as necessary to develop, test and support your iOS applications and to enable the making of 
authenticated calls to certain LinkedIn APIs in your iOS applications .  For clarity, your use of the LinkedIn APIs shall be 
conditional on you entering into the LinkedIn API Terms of Use, the current version of which is located at 
https://developer.linkedin.com/legal/api-terms-of-use, or another governing agreement with LinkedIn.  You agree not to: (i) 
remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained on any material included in the iOS SDK; 
or (ii) use the iOS SDK for any purpose that violates any law or any proprietary right of any person or that would expose 
LinkedIn to legal liability.  Your use, reproduction and distribution of components of the iOS SDK that are licensed under an 
open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not this Agreement.  

2. Reservation of Rights.  Except for those limited rights expressly granted in Section 1, as between you and LinkedIn, 
LinkedIn retains all right, title and interest in and to the iOS SDK including all intellectual property rights.  This Agreement does 
not grant you permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks or brand names of LinkedIn, except to reproduce 
attribution notices.  LinkedIn may update or modify the iOS SDK or stop providing the iOS SDK (or any portion thereof) in its 
sole discretion, in each case without prior notice.

3. Warranty Disclaimer.  THE IOS SDK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND LINKEDIN EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY 
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-
INFRINGEMENT.  LINKEDIN DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE IOS SDK IS FREE OF 
INACCURACIES, ERRORS OR BUGS.  YOUR USE OF THE IOS SDK IS AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND YOU WILL BE 
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE THEREOF. 

4. Limitation of Liability.  LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY LEGAL 
THEORY (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE IOS SDK, WHETHER OR 
NOT LINKEDIN WAS AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF LINKEDIN 
AND ITS AFFILIATES FOR DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $100.  SOME 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR 
EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF 
THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

5. General.  Either party may assign this Agreement, without consent, in connection with a reorganization, merger, 
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of such party’s assets or stock.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind 
and inure to the benefit of each party’s successors and permitted assigns.  This Agreement will be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of California notwithstanding any conflicts of law principles and the United Nations 
Convention for the International Sale of Goods, and any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement must be brought in a 
federal or state court within Santa Clara County, California.  LinkedIn may notify you under this Agreement via postings on the 
LinkedIn Developer Site, located at https://developer.linkedin.com/ or via the email address associated with your application or 
LinkedIn member account.  You may contact us online or via mail or courier at: LinkedIn Corporation ATTN: Legal Department, 
2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.  Any notices that you provide without compliance with this section shall 
have no legal effect.  If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, that provision will be modified to render it enforceable 
to the extent possible to achieve the parties’ intention and the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected.  A party’s 
waiver of any breach of this Agreement by the other party will not constitute a waiver of any rights or any subsequent breach of 
the same or different provision.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject 
matter hereof, and this Agreement may be amended only in writing and signed by both parties.
